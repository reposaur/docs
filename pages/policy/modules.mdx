In Rego, policies are defined inside _modules_. Modules consist of:

- Exactly one [Package][packages] declaration.
- Zero or more [Import][imports] statements.
- Zero or more [Rule][rules] definitions.

Package names are particularly important in Reposaur. See the [Namespaces](/policy/namespaces)
section to learn more.
