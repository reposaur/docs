# Reposaur

**Reposaur** is a tool to audit your GitHub repositories, pull requests and
issues against custom policies, validating they follow your organization's
security and best practices guidelines.

Policies are written in the well-known Rego language and enable different
organizations to express their specific rules and guidelines through code.
Apart from custom policies, users can benefit from a comprehensive library of
common rules that can be re-used or adapted to different use cases.

A simple policy with a single rule looks like this:

```rego
# ./policy/repository.rego
package repository

# METADATA
# title: Repository default branch is not protected
# description: >
#  The repository default branch isn't protected meaning anyone with `write`
#  access can commit directly to the branch.
violation_default_branch_not_protected {
    resp := github.request("GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/protection", {
        "owner": input.owner.login,
        "repo": input.name,
        "branch": input.default_branch,
    })
}
```

Using the CLI, it can be executed against a repository like:

```bash
$ gh api /repos/reposaur/reposaur | rsr exec
```

Which will result in the following SARIF report:

        "owner": "reposaur",
        "repo": "reposaur"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The same policy can be run against multiple repositories at once, for example:

```shell
$ gh /orgs/reposaur/repos --paginate | rsr exec
# { ... }
# { ... }
# { ... }
```
