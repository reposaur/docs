# Reposaur

**Reposaur** is a tool to audit your GitHub repositories, pull requests and
issues against custom policies, validating they follow your organization's
security and best practices guidelines.

Policies are written in the well-known Rego language and enable different
organizations to express their specific rules and guidelines through code.
Apart from custom policies, users can benefit from a comprehensive library of
common rules that can be re-used or adapted to different use cases.

A simple, one-rule policy looks like this:

```rego
package repository

violation_default_branch_not_protected {
    github.request("/repos/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/protection", {
        "owner": input.owner.login,
        "repo": input.name,
        "branch": input.default_branch,
    })
}
```
